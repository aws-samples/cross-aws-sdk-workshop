## Cross AWS SDK workshop

Welcome to the Cross AWS SDK Workshop. This workshop demonstrates the features
shared across the AWS SDKs with an example serverless application.

The modules in this workshop are designed to give you hands-on experience using
the AWS SDKs features within your applications to make you more productive. We
hope you find them useful and inspiring!

The example application consists of several decoupled components that come
together to form a serverless application for uploading Podcast RSS feeds,
episodes, and transcribing those episodes into text.

The components in this serverless application are selected to highlight AWS SDK
features you can take advantage of in your own application in a realistic
scenarios. This workshop will guide you through taking advantage of AWS SDK
features in several of the Amazon Lambda Handler functions in your preferred
language.
