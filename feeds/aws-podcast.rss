Technology aided the outcome, but dedicated people were at the center and the tremendous level of effort needed is not sustainable. Still, now that the industry knows what’s possible, the question is how to reach the same high watermark. One area of focus is managing clinical trials data in the cloud, which can reduce R&amp;amp;D costs and accelerate scientific discovery. Listen to the podcast to hear emerging best practices regarding clinical trials data management from Drew Garty, CTO of Veeva Vault Clinical Data Management Suite.

Technology aided the outcome, but dedicated people were at the center and the tremendous level of effort needed is not sustainable. Still, now that the industry knows what’s possible, the question is how to reach the same high watermark. One area of focus is managing clinical trials data in the cloud, which can reduce R&amp;amp;D costs and accelerate scientific discovery. Listen to the podcast to hear emerging best practices regarding clinical trials data management from Drew Garty, CTO of Veeva Vault Clinical Data Management Suite. Veeva is a leader in cloud-based software for the global life sciences industry and is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner.

Of course, the execution turned out to be challenging. Charity:water first tried collaborating with leading IoT sensor manufacturers to get existing technology tailored to its specific use case, which is monitoring hand pump functionality in real-time, across remote communities. When that didn’t work, charity:water had the gumption to try to develop the solution themselves. But the org faced frustration and stalls before finding the right partner. With AWS Partner Twisthink, charity:water found a true collaborator that recognized its core business is a vital mission.Together, they developed an IoT sensor built on AWS that allows real-time monitoring of remote wells around the world, slashing repair time by years. Listen to the podcast to hear about the development process and learn about the IoT roadmap to reshape the approach to meeting the global clean water crisis.

Snowcone is ruggedized, secure, and purpose-built for use outside of a traditional data center. Its small form factor makes it a perfect fit for tight spaces or where portability is a necessity. You can use Snowcone in backpacks on first responders, or for IoT, vehicular, and even drone use cases. In this podcast, learn about the importance of computing at the edge, how the AWS Snow Family helps customers with compute and data transfer applications at the edge, and the benefits and use cases of AWS Snowcone.

Simon sits down with Amazon CTO, Dr. Werner Vogels, to hear where his digital life has roamed recently, and what he has seen along the way. That includes everything from people with almost no coding skills quickly building applications to help their communities get through this hard period, to the notion of customers dialing-in “cost aware architectures,” and startups tackling the world’s toughest problems on Vogels’ show “Now Go Build.” Running through every example Vogels gives is the idea that, especially now, we have the ability and the need to build digital systems that address our very human needs. Oh, and music to listen to when you are coding until 4 a.m.

Today Simon is joined by Edgar Haren, Sr. Product Marketing Manager with Amazon Web Services and Curran O’Brien, Migration Business Development with AWS, to discuss the value organizations can find when working towards cloud migration readiness, and how the new Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool (CART) can help kick-start the process. Across thousands of migration consultations, we found that AWS customers weren’t struggling with the technical aspects of a migration, as much as the Operational and Organizational elements. Completing a cloud readiness assessment with CART can transform your idea of moving to the cloud into a detailed plan that follows AWS Professional Services best practices.

As a former CTO, CIO, and COO, Steve also shares emerging best practices to cut costs mid-term while keeping sight on innovation goals. 

He says starting a dialogue within your team is the first step to modernizing. To begin the conversation, individuals can self-assess organizational readiness in minutes by using the Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool (https://cart.splashthat.com/) and then, later, discuss results as a team.

Express Workflows are a new type of AWS Step Functions workflow type that cost-effectively orchestrate AWS compute, database, and messaging services at event rates greater than 100,000 events per second. Express Workflows automatically start in response to events such as HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda requests, AWS IoT Rules Engine actions, and over 100 other AWS and SaaS event sources from Amazon EventBridge. Express Workflows is suitable for high-volume event processing workloads such as IoT data ingestion, streaming data processing and transformation, and high-volume microservices orchestration.

We published a podcast (https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/#266) on provable security (https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/)  last fall, and, due to high customer interest, we decided to bring you a regular peek into this AWS initiative. This series will cover how the traditionally academic field of automated reasoning is being applied at AWS at scale to help provide higher assurances for our customers, regulators, and the broader cloud industry. We’ll talk to individuals whose minds helped shape the history of automated reasoning, as well as learn from engineers and scientists who are applying automated reasoning to help solve pressing security and privacy challenges in the cloud.
 
In our first interview, Byron Cook, Director of the AWS Automated Reasoning Group, sits down with Moshe Vardi, Karen Ostrum George Distinguished Service Professor in Computational Engineering and Director of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology. Moshe describes the history of logic, automated reasoning, formal verification and his legendary moustache.

All it takes is a few bad ratings, and users will be unlikely to even download your application. One of the keys to producing quality mobile applications is thorough testing, but individual developers can't afford to own thousands of devices, let alone manage the infrastructure for running test harnesses against all those devices. In this episode, we introduce AWS Device Farm that lets mobile app developers test their apps against a wide array of mobile devices and catch bugs early so you can focus on introducing new features and functionality to delight your users rather than spending all your cycles responding to and fixing issues reported in reviews and rankings.

Often there are questions as to what VCs are looking for in Startups, and conversely, what Startups should be looking for in VCs. Many startups use AWS as an efficient, low-cost and scalable platform to try out their ideas, with the ability to scale when they are successful. 

We discuss some of the nuances of the VC space, what VCs are looking for and how Intel Capital looks to invest in these types of businesses. As many of our listeners are running their own startup - we hope this is of real use!

Statements in this document that refer to Intel’s plans and expectations for the quarter, the year, and the future, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A detailed discussion of the factors that could affect Intel’s results and plans is included in Intel’s SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K.
